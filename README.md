 # **Stable Diffusion** ðŸŽ¨ 
*...using `ðŸ§¨diffusers`*

Stable Diffusion is a text-to-image latent diffusion model created by the researchers and engineers from [CompVis](https://github.com/CompVis), [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/) and [LAION](https://laion.ai/). It's trained on 512x512 images from a subset of the [LAION-5B](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/) database. This model uses a frozen CLIP ViT-L/14 text encoder to condition the model on text prompts. With its 860M UNet and 123M text encoder, the model is relatively lightweight and runs on a GPU with at least 10GB VRAM.
See the [model card](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion) for more information.
This Colab notebook shows how to use Stable Diffusion with the ðŸ¤— Hugging Face [ðŸ§¨ Diffusers library](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) .

Real-ESRGAN aims at developing Practical Algorithms for General Image/Video Restoration.We extend the powerful ESRGAN to a practical restoration application (namely, Real-ESRGAN), which is trained with pure synthetic data.

# **SwinIR**

SwinIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on six tasks: image super-resolution (including classical, lightweight and real-world image super-resolution), image denoising (including grayscale and color image denoising) and JPEG compression artifact reduction. See our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10257) and [project page](https://github.com/JingyunLiang/SwinIR) for detailed results.

## **GFPGAN** - Towards Real-World Blind Face Restoration with Generative Facial Prior

GFPGAN is a blind face restoration algorithm towards real-world face images. <br>
It leverages the generative face prior in a pre-trained GAN (*e.g.*, StyleGAN2) to restore realistic faces while precerving fidelity. <br>
